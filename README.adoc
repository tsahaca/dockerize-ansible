. run the docker image by mounting your project folder which contains ansible playbook and inventory files

. docker run -it --rm  -v ${PWD}:/work -w /work --net host ansible /bin/bash
. ansible --version
. run the ansible playbook as 
. ansible-playbook -i inventory/virtualbox.hosts playbooks/virtualbox.yml
